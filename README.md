# Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮

This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game I built to learn and practice **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It's a fun little project that helped me understand the basics of web development, including DOM manipulation, styling, and game logic.

## 🔍 Features

- 2-player mode (same device)
- Interactive UI with winning/draw message
- Basic game reset functionality
- Clean and responsive layout

## 📚 What I Learned

- Structuring a web page with HTML
- Styling with CSS (including flexbox and basic animations)
- Handling user interactions and game logic using JavaScript
- DOM manipulation and event handling
